The diff between SelectEvents.cc and SelectEvents_bkp.cc is that I removed the super complicated stuff I was doing to select the particle type.
I found a new way of doing it, which is in SelectOneEvent, and transposed in SelectEvents.cc

Come from the execution of Loop_SelectEvents.sh with all statistics:
for (int i=100;i<600;i+=100){SelectEvents("or",i,"1","neutron");}
for (int i=100;i<600;i+=100){SelectEvents("or",i,"1","neutron",1);}
for (int i=100;i<600;i+=100){SelectEvents("or",i,"20","neutron");}
for (int i=100;i<600;i+=100){SelectEvents("or",i,"20","neutron",1);}
